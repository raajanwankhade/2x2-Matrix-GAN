# 2x2-Matrix-GAN

A simple use of the generator and discriminator architectures for generating a 2x2 matrix with top-left and bottom-right squares with value close to 1 and top-right and bottom-left squares with values closer to 0. This is done using GANs where noise is fed into the trained generator (with discriminator as its adversary), which returns a generated matrix with 2x2 with the required specifications.
